## About
-----------
Senior Living Services is an assisted living referral company. Our client helps families find assisted living homes for their loved ones. 

##Reason 
---------
Our client needed a website that provided a portal where visitors and potential clients can search for facilities in their area as well as learn more about the services our client provides. So we decided to polish the working application by using React.js and MongoDB.
We  also added  a method of lead generation for the business owner by collecting user data and storing it to a database only accessible by an administrator.
